# SonicTheHedgeHog--iGraphicsProject

Sonic The HedgeHog
Language we used : C++
Framework : iGraphics(based on OpenGL)
Type : Simple 2D game
Lines of code : 1641(including comments and gapes)

This is mainly a simple 2D game. We have developed using c++ with igraphics framework for our 2nd semester Software Development Project. It was really amazing journey to develop a game. Although it is very simple game but for me as a fresher it's make me feel really so good to see something visible because we always write program and see output on a black screen which really dont make any sense ... After doing this project, i felt like I have learned something. 

BTW, we have named this name 'Sonic The HedgeHog' because we used sonic character as our main character. And our plan was too big for this game. We had planned to add much more feature and level. But for time shortage, we changed our plan. This game took approximately straight 20-25 hours (roughly 2 months)if we just count work time.
